## [Local tool](https://pypi.org/project/mt-thresholds/)

```bash
pip3 install mt-thresholds

# accuracy is 63.989%
mt-thresholds bleu 1.00

# ChrF needs 0.710 difference for the same accuracy as BLEU
mt-thresholds chrf 0.63989 --delta
```

Or use from Python:
```python3
import mt_thresholds

mt_thresholds.accuracy(1.0, "bleu") # 0.63989
mt_thresholds.delta(0.63989, "chrf") # 0.665
```
## Experiment code

We plan to release the code for replicating WMT results in upcoming months.
